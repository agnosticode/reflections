What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
* I create a hidden .git directory in the folder we want to track
* That hidden folder is responsible for tracking the history of the files that folder contains

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?
* Repository is what contains the history of changes in files
* Staging is different in such a way that it give chance to add only those file which are responsible for logical change per commit
